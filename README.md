This is a programe for to solve a Rubik's cube in 20 moves(God's number).

At least this is a trial to make it solve a Rubik's cube, because it can only solve up to 9 moves scrambles in a acceptable time(like 10 seconds for 9 move scrambles)

It uses a IDA* search algorithm to find the optimal solution.
Don't bother the variable and method names because they are kind of giberish cannot be understand easily (I wrote this code for fun).
Only thing you need to know if you ever wanted to try it is the main script is idash.java and there is a String variable called "mix". If you want to give a new scramble, change the string values in that list and hit run. It will give you the solution.

I do not know but if you noticed there is another script called idashReverse.java. It is for try to find the solution as well as from the beckwards at the same time as it tries to search from the beggining(well ofcourse not at the same time because I did not implament a parallel computing but I think you get the idea from saying at the same time). It is not used in this version. It only searches from the start.

If you there I chalange you to understand and improve it. Because I already forgat why I named them as that so it is so hard to understand to me too. But again do not judge me because it was for fun.
